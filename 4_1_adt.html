<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-10">In 7th grade, students will encounter expressions with positive and negative rational numbers.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-11">As coursework progresses, students will write expressions to model different types of functions such as exponential and quadratic functions.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-12">Being able to examine numeric expressions and identify and abstract patterns is an important part of being able to write explicit rules to model a function.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-13">In later grades, students will see more complex equations.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-14">In 7th and 8th grade, students see equations that involve multiple steps to reach a solution and encounter equations with no solution and infinitely many solutions.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-15">Students also go on to solve different types of equations such as quadratic and exponential equations and rely on the understanding what it means to solve an equation and the role inverse operations play in the solving process.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-16">In 8th grade, students will be introduced to negative exponents and the exponent properties.</p>
