<p><strong>Letters to Represent Unknowns:</strong> You have seen symbols being used to represent unknown quantities in expressions and equations for many years. Early on, unknown quantities were represented by question marks and boxes. Later, letters were used to represent unknown quantities. Do the following problems look familiar?</p>
<ul class="list-none pl-6 space-y-2">
<li>5 + ? = 11</li>
<li>4 	× ☒ = 12</li>
<li>300 ÷ x = 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Variables to Communicate Mathematical Ideas:</strong> You have also seen letters used to communicate mathematical ideas, such as the Properties of Addition and Multiplication. For example, we can state the Commutative Property of Addition using <strong>words</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>Commutative Property of Addition: Changing the order of the addends in an addition problem does not change the result.</blockquote>
<p>We can also illustrate the Commutative Property of Addition using <strong>letters and symbols</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>Commutative Property of Addition: a + b = b + a</blockquote>
<p>We also see letters in geometry formulas. For example, we can state the formula for the area of a triangle using <strong>words</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>Area of a Triangle: Multiply the base and the height of the triangle and then divide the result by two.</blockquote>
<p>We can also show this formula using <strong>letters and symbols</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>A = \( \frac{b \times h}{2} \)</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Variables to Show Relationships Between Quantities:</strong> We have also seen variables being used to represent relationships between two quantities. For example, we can express how to change feet into inches using <strong>words</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>To find the number of inches in a specified number of feet, multiply the number of feet by 12.</blockquote>
<p>We can also show this relationship using <strong>letters and symbols</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>i = 12f</blockquote>
<p>In this case, we may treat one of the variables as an unknown. For example, we may ask, “How many inches are in 3 feet?” In this case, i is an unknown number and we can determine that it is equal to 36. Alternatively, we can treat the variables as a set of numbers and examine how one variable changes as the other changes. I may want to know how many inches are in 1 foot, 2 feet, 3 feet, 4 feet, and 5 feet.</p>
