<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-2">In previous grades, students worked with the properties of operations
                with whole numbers, fractions, and decimals.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-3">In 5th grade, students learned how to use whole number exponents to
                represent powers of ten.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-4">Students have been writing numerical expressions throughout their elementary course work.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-5">Additionally, students have been writing and solving equations,
                representing the unknown with question marks, boxes, and letters.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-6">Many of the examples used in the problems in this Chapter rely on
                previous work done in 6th grade.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-7">For example, students learned about the area formulas for polygons in
                Chapter 5.</p>
<p class="mb-4" data-id="text-4-8">Students also rely on their understanding of percent, statistics, and
                many other domains studied earlier in the year.</p>
