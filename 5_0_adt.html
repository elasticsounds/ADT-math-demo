<p class="mb-4"><strong>Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.</strong></p>
<p class="mb-4" tabindex="0">Desiree is making a flag in the shape of a triangle for a parade float. To fit on the float,
                the area of the flag can be no more than 600 square inches. She has decided to make the height of the
                flag equal to 3\(\frac{1}{2}\) feet. Write an inequality to represent possible lengths for the base of the flag.
            </p>
<p class="mb-4" tabindex="0">\[ b \leq 28.571428 \]</p>
<p class="mb-4" tabindex="0"><em>When students are solving inequalities, they need to be able to interpret the
                    solution. Mathematically, the solution above tells us that the base can be any length \(\leq
                    28.571428\); however, in the real world, it is not likely that someone would measure to this degree of
                    precision. It is more likely that this person would measure to the nearest inch or half inch. In the
                    problem above, students might reason that Desiree would make the base of the flag 28 inches or 28.5
                    inches. In similar problems, the quantities being considered are whole objects, such as people.
                    Students take this into consideration when considering solutions to the problem.</em></p>

<p tabindex="0">Peter is checking his suitcase at the airport. He puts it on the scale and the person working at the
                counter tells him that his bag weighs 1\(\frac{1}{2}\) times the weight limit for checked baggage. If Peter's
                bag weighs 75 pounds, what is the weight limit for checked bags?</p>
<p class="mt-4" tabindex="0"><em>Throughout this chapter, students are transitioning to a more abstract way of thinking.
                    In the problem above, students are asked to set up and solve an equation for the problem given.
                    Teachers and students are encouraged to use numeric examples and models to arrive at the equation or
                    symbolic representation of the situation.</em></p>
